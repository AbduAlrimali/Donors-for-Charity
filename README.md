# Donors-for-Charity
we will apply explanatory data analysis and machine learning algorithms to accurately identify the individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. we will choose the best algorithm by comparing results and try to optimize that algorithm to model the data best.

We aim to construct a model that can predict whether and individual makes more than $50,000. This can help fund organizations that survive on donations, understanding an individual income can help identify the number of donations to request.
